## Time series clustering exercise:

Cleaned the data, clustered the NUMBER OF ESTABLISHMENTS time series with K-means
in 5 clusters and overlayed clustered data on a NYC map. Used hierarchical clustering to make a dandrogram.

## Subway timeseries

Identified the 4 stations with the most prominent periodic trend on an annual period (52 weeks) using fourier transform

The 0th, 194th, 150th, 327th.

Identified groups of time series that look similar among each other, using the four features engineered in HW11.

Grouped work with Evgeniya
