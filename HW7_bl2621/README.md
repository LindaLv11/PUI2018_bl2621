## Assignment 1: census geospatial analysis.

 familiarized with the US Census data (really the 1-year survey data) and at the same time exercised with spatial analysis in geopandas. Assessed if the linkNYC stations are located to provide a useful service and to fill in a need. Worked with the American Fact Finder data via API and direct download, and with NYC shapefiles.
