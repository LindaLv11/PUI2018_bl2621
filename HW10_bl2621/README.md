## Assignment 1:
Finished the in class lab

## Assignment 2:
Studied how does the light coming from a window relate to the total energy consumption.
Answered the question that if we have data on the energy consumed by a building how well does that relate to the number of units in the building.

As a result, the model of Energy vs Units is better than the model of Units vs Energy. 
The Energy should be the dependent variable, the Units is the independent variable.

Used the LR test to see which function best represents the relationship between Energy and Units. As a result, the curve fit is better. 

Grouped worked with Rufie Sheng on this homework. We discussed about the Chi-square function.
